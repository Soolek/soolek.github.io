  <h1 class="page-heading">Code and Drive</h1>

  <p>Two things I am passionate about: software development and driving. Being able to code my behaviour allows me to improve my driving skills, which in turn results in better driving algorithms.</p>
  <p>In 2023, I was awarded a Ph.D. in engineering and technical sciences in the discipline of automation, electronics, electrical engineering and space technologies based on my doctoral thesis on driving an autonomous car.</p>
  <p>I will share my experiences from both programming and effective driving on this blog. Enjoy!</p>
