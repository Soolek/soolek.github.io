  <p>I am passionate about programming as well as driving. Being able to program my behaviour allows me to improve my driving skills, which in turn results in better driving algorithms.</p>
  <p>I have been developing software and driving competitively for many years. The recent boom for autonomous driving is the perfect combination of both of my passions that is why I try to devote all of my free time for it to become best at it.</p>
  <p>I will share my experiences from both programming and effective driving on this blog. Enjoy!</p>
