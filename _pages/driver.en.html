	<h3>History</h3>
	<p><img class="left-image" src="/assets/images/driver/child.jpg" style="height: 140px;">From a young age I was fascinated by spectacular driving. I analyzed the behavior of cars and drivers in response to changing track conditions. I paid special attention to car controll during skidding. As soon as I managed to experience it myself, I knew I had discovered my life's passion.</p>
	<p><img class="right-image" src="/assets/images/driver/lada2107.jpg" style="height: 160px;">I started my sports career with a rear-wheel drive Lada 2107, in which, after basic repairs, I took part in my first amateur rally. I saved every penny to be able to drive as I imagined - pushing the limits of the car's capabilities. The hard work paid off and that same year I managed to win at the provincial level (competing with crews almost twice as strong) in 2007.</p>

	<p><img class="left-image" src="/assets/images/driver/e46.jpg" style="height: 160px;">I quickly realized that something was missing in this form of motorsport. I loved controlling slides, but racing against the clock did not allow me to compete directly. Fortunately, at the beginning of this millennium, drifting began to become popular in Poland. The first drifting competitions also appeared, which motivated me to take part in them.</p>
