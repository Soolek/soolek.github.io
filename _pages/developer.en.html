	<p>My programming adventure began in the early 1990s on the Atari65XE, where I first experimented by replicating code from foreign-language texts and soon transitioned to creating simple text-based games. That early hands-on experience instilled a profound appreciation for instructing machines with precision, setting the stage for a career defined by relentless curiosity and innovation.</p>
	<p>Since 2005, I have been developing commercial software with a focus on the .NET ecosystem — from the pioneering days of .NET Framework 2.0 to today’s modern platforms. I excel at designing both desktop and web applications, specializing in backend systems and microservice architectures. I rigorously follow S.O.L.I.D. principles to ensure that each project is built on a foundation of scalable, maintainable, and resilient design, even in complex distributed environments.</p>
	<p>During my PhD, I immersed myself in rigorous research that sharpened my analytical and problem-solving skills. Delving deep into advanced algorithmic techniques and data analysis with Python, I bridged the divide between theoretical frameworks and practical applications. This academic journey refined my technical expertise, fueled my passion for innovation, and reinforced my commitment to employing cutting-edge methodologies in software development.</p>
