	<p>My adventure with programming began in the early 90's with Atari65XE: It started with copying programs found in a foreign-language book, then over time I started writing my first simple text games.</p>
	<p>The idea of machine following my directives to the letter was very appealing. I quickly learned how to use fundamental rules to create interesting and useful tools to solve any problem. It quickly became my passion, and with each program I wrote I wanted to learn more about how to utilize the power that lies dormant in the computer.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>I am a programmer creating commercial software since 2005. I specialize in .NET technology (starting with .NET Framework 2.0) in which I create desktop and web solutions.</p>
	<p>My specialization is back-end solutions: I practice and inspire others to use S.O.L.I.D. principles, because I believe that good architecture based on these principles is error-proof even in a micro-service environment.</p>
