  <article class="post-content">
	<p>I started to create programs in early 90' on Atari65XE by rewriting programs found in an old book. After some time I got the hang of it and proceed to write my own first text-based computer games.</p>
	<p>The idea of machine following my directives to the letter was very appealing to me as I could create something helpful and interesting with it. This quickly became my passion, so I wanted to learn more with each written program to utilize the power of computers.</p>
	<p>I have been developing commercially since 2005. I specialize in .NET technology in which I have been creating desktop and web (front as well as back-end) solutions. I am a S.O.L.I.D. principles evangelist since I believe that architecture based on those principles is very encouraging to any future changes that might be introduced.</p>
